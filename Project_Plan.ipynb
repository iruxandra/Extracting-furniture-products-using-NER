    "- Spacey identifies tokens in text\n",
    "- Need to look at the HTML and select the body of the text (make sure it contains the product names - found in headers)\n",
    "- Would crawl the text from web pages using BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Add extension that removes 404 error websites\n",
    "- Save this to a new data frame (add column with HTML text for each website)\n",
    "- Using spacey ent.label_=='PRODUCT' add tokens and identify all products in the body of text\n",
    "- Use displacy to see what it has selected\n",
    "- If not all words are found then add matchers for extra tokens\n",
    "- Create a new data frame that stores approx. 100 pages\n",

    "        - Validate model (on the remaining 20% of the data)\n",
